Online ordering system that we are proposing here, greatly simplifies the ordering process for both the students and the faculties of 
GLA University. System presents an interactive and up-to-date menu with all available options in an easy to use manner. Users can choose 
one or more items to place an order which will land in the Cart. Users can view all the order details in the cart before placing the order. 
Once the order is placed it is entered in the database and retrieved in pretty much real time. This allows Canteen Employees to quickly go 
through the orders as they are received and process all orders efficiently and effectively with minimal delays and confusion.
